<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a multi-instructor learning platform from scratch, following user requirements. Initial steps involved clarifying integrations (OpenAI GPT-5 mini, Stripe, SendGrid) and exploring the project structure. The development proceeded in phases: core backend/frontend setup, essential student flows (authentication, course catalog, payment with coupons), and then the instructor dashboard (course creation, structured content with sections, lessons, quizzes, live classes). During the process, the AI engineer diligently used bulk file writers and  for extensive code modifications, handled environment setup (dependencies, ), and utilized  and  for testing. Key challenges included correcting UI file overwrites and refining course structure based on user feedback. The current phase involves building the Admin Panel, with initial components and styling added.

The goal is to build a Coursera-style multi-instructor learning platform allowing instructors to create/sell courses, and students to enroll, learn, and earn certificates. It requires Admin, Instructor, and Student dashboards, course management, payment processing, and AI-assisted features (recommendations, tutor, course generator).

Key modules include:
- Instructor Portal: Login, course creation (title, description, category, price, cover image, lessons, quizzes), tracking enrollment/earnings, AI course assistant.
- Student Dashboard: Browse courses (filters, detail page with preview, syllabus, enroll button), progress tracking, quiz module, certificate generation, AI tutor chatbot.
- Admin Panel: User/course/instructor management, analytics, commission adjustment, feature courses.
- Monetization: Stripe integration for one-time purchases/subscriptions, revenue split, auto-enrollment, payment history.
- AI Layer: AI Tutor, AI Course Generator, AI Recommendation Engine.
- Certificate System: Custom PDF generation with student/course details.
- UI & Navigation: Modern green/white theme, responsive, navigation bar.
- Authentication: Role-based access (Admin/Instructor/Student), protected routes.

So far, the platform has:
- User authentication (registration, login) and role-based access.
- Basic course discovery (landing page, catalog, course detail page).
- A functional payment flow with Stripe and a coupon system.
- A student course player with lesson viewing, progress tracking, and an AI tutor sidebar.
- An instructor dashboard for creating courses with sections, lessons (video/PDF/text), quizzes, and live classes.
- Admin portal for coupon management.

**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core FastAPI application. It defines all database models (User, Course, Lesson, Enrollment, Payment, Quiz, QuizResult, Certificate, Coupon, Section, LiveClass) and implements all CRUD and business logic APIs for authentication, course management, enrollments, payments, AI integration, coupons, sections, quizzes, and live classes. It was extensively modified throughout the development to add new models, routes, and logic for each feature.
*   **/app/backend/.env**: Stores critical environment variables for backend operations, including , , , , and . Updated to include necessary API keys for integrations.

*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component that sets up routing using  and manages global state (e.g., user authentication). It was frequently updated to add new routes as pages were created (e.g., , , , , , , , , ).
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains global and component-specific CSS styles. It was modified to implement the modern green and white theme, as well as styles for newly added components across various dashboards and pages.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/CourseDetail.jsx**: Displays details of a specific course. It was crucial for integrating the Stripe payment checkout process and the coupon application feature. Changes included adding the Enroll Now button logic, coupon input field, and price calculation based on coupon.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/ManageCourse.jsx**: This instructor-facing page allows instructors to create and edit courses. It was significantly refactored to support a hierarchical course structure, allowing instructors to add sections, lessons (video/PDF/text), quizzes, and live classes. This involved integrating several new instructor components.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/CoursePlayer.jsx**: The student's learning interface. It was heavily modified to display lessons (video, text), provide navigation, track progress, show AI tutor, and later to integrate tabs for quizzes, live classes, and certificate display. It now handles marking lessons complete and potentially triggering certificate generation.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/CouponManager.jsx**: A new component created for the Admin Dashboard to manage coupons (create, view, edit).
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/instructor/** and **/app/frontend/src/components/student/**: New directories and components were created within these to modularize the UI for instructor and student dashboards, respectively, including forms for creating course elements and views for learning progress.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/admin/**: A new directory containing components for the admin panel, such as , , and , which are currently being integrated into .
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Frontend Implementation for Admin Panel**: Fully wire up , ,  with backend APIs.
- **Course Player Functionality**: Implement actual quiz submission logic, live class joining interface, and PDF certificate download.
- **Instructor Dashboard Enhancement**: Full implementation of forms for adding detailed lesson/quiz content, AI course assistant for content generation, and earnings withdrawal requests.
- **Student Engagement Features**: Course reviews and ratings, course preview, progress notifications, email notifications.
- **Admin Panel Features**: Course moderation (review/approve/reject), featured courses management.
- **Profile & Settings**: Edit profile details, view/download certificates (beyond display), instructor application form for students.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on setting up the **complete Admin Panel**. The task was to implement user management, instructor approvals, course moderation, platform analytics, and featured courses.

The AI engineer has successfully initiated this phase by:
1.  **Creating Admin Components**: Three new React components were created under :
    *   : Intended for viewing and managing all users.
    *   : Designed to review and approve/reject new instructor applications.
    *   : For displaying revenue, growth, and engagement metrics.
2.  **Integrating into Admin Dashboard**: The main  file was updated to incorporate these new components, likely using a tabbed or sectional layout to organize different admin functionalities.
3.  **Styling**: A new directory for admin components was created, and comprehensive CSS was added to  to style these new admin features, ensuring they align with the platform's green and white theme.
4.  **Service Restart**: The services (backend and frontend) were restarted to apply the newly added components and CSS changes.

The current state is that the foundational frontend components for the Admin Panel are in place, styled, and integrated into the  page. The next logical step is to connect these UI components to the corresponding backend APIs to make them fully functional.
